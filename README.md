# Global-sales
Creating a program for sales analysis

## Summary
In this report, we are helping a global distribution organization to gather to provide indepth analysis of their data. Especially, the company is interested in understanding aspects such as sales, shipping costs and what are the factors affecting them according to the data (and indeed factors that may have been assumed to affect them but don’t according to the data).

We are tasked with the production of an application that allows a user in the organisation to explore some of the most interesting aspects of this dataset. We will compute the dataset and implement Unit Profits statistics.

We will then assess the evolution of sales, profits and quantities ordered over the years, by providing line plots and barplots, before interpreting those.

After that, we will try to understand what is affecting the Shipping Costs. We will produce a correlation matrix among numeric data and provide a plot checking the impact of Shipping Mode on cost.

Thus, we will compute the option for the user to input 2 countries for comparison. This comparison will provide the value counts for subcategories and visualisations for the comparison.

We will also give our personal insights on the dataset. It is always appreciated to have external point of view on the data to challenge assumptions. We will provide visualisations and comments regarding those.

Finally, we will give a summary and recommendations on our findings.
